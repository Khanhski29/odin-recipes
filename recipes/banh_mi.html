        <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fish sauce</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>How to Make Banh Mi</h2>
    <p>Banh Mi is quite simple to make, it's just a little time consuming. You'll find the full, detailed recipe below — but here's what you can expect when making this pho:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
        <li>Combine beef, fish sauce, soy sauce, freshly ground black pepper, and 5-spice powder in a bowl, and mix until evenly combined. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled.</li>
        <li>Mix mayonnaise, hoisin, and Sriracha together in a small bowl for sauce. Keep chilled until needed. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil.</li>
        <li>Cut open rolls, remove about 1/2 of the inside crumb, and place on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake rolls in the preheated oven until toasted, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, using damp hands, shape beef mixture into two burger patties sized to match your rolls or buns. Keep in the refrigerator until needed.</li>
        <li>Combine carrots and daikon radish in a bowl. Add rice vinegar and toss to coat. Refrigerate until needed.</li>
        <li>Preheat a charcoal grill to high heat.</li>
        <li>Cook burgers over the hot coals until desired doneness is reached and they spring back to the touch, turning as needed, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the centers should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Slather toasted buns with mayo mixture. Place cucumbers and jalapeno slices on bottom of rolls, and top with cooked burgers. Top with carrot-radish mixture and cilantro.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
